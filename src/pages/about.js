The Thirty-One Percent started as an idea among two friends in 2017. We were tired of seeing profile after profile of successful women as the same questions. How do you get it all done? Can women really have it all?  We wanted to meet these women that we looked up to, and tell stories they hadn’t already had the opportunity to tell. What really goes into running a business? Why did you get started in the first place? Did you really have it all figured out early in your career?

<p className="pb-5 text-center text-xl">
With two types of profiles—five-year-plans, which takes a sweeping view of the subjects career, from age 20 to present and 9-to-5’s, taking you through a founders typical day (which never starts at 9, and always goes way later than 5)—we hope to bring new stories to light. Often, women say that this is the first time they’ve gotten to tell this story to the world.

Over two years, this project bloomed into a community. I hope that this site will continue to inspire young women that whatever they are passionate about, they can find a way to bring it into the world. Whether it succeeds or fails, they’re ideas are just as good. And if they still aren’t sure what that passion is, there is plenty of time.
